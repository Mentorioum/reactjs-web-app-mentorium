# Practice

### Exercise - Optimization.
1. Check the performance by using tools described in the theory, for example in the `ContactList` component.
1. Measure the speed of the `ContactList` render, make a note of the time.
1. Measure the speed of the `Contact Item` render of the Expand / Collapse.
1. Add `Pure` if a component has made like `class` or Memo.
1. After optimize check the differences by measuring the speed again.
